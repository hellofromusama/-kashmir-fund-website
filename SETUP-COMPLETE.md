## ⚠️ FINAL STEPS NEEDED:

### Step 1: Fix GoDaddy DNS Record (2 minutes)
**Current Issue:** You have a CNAME record for `www` that needs to be an A record.

1. Go to: https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/iamstandingwithkashmir.org/dns
2. **Delete** the CNAME record: `www → iamstandingwithkashmir.org`
3. **Add** new A record:
   - Type: `A`
   - Name: `www`
   - Value: `76.76.21.21`
   - TTL: `1/2 Hour`
4. Click **Save**

**Current DNS Status:**
- ✅ Root domain (`@`) → `76.76.21.21` (Correct!)
- ❌ WWW (`www`) → CNAME to `iamstandingwithkashmir.org` (Needs to be A record!)

### Step 2: Wait for DNS Propagation (10-60 minutes)
After fixing the DNS record, wait for propagation:
- Check status: https://dnschecker.org/#A/iamstandingwithkashmir.org
- Both root and www should show `76.76.21.21`

### Step 3: Create Stripe Webhook (5 minutes)
**Do this AFTER the domain is live!**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **+ Add endpoint**
3. Endpoint URL: `https://iamstandingwithkashmir.org/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Click **Add endpoint**
6. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
7. Add to Vercel:
   ```bash
   cd c:/Users/Usama.Javed/Desktop/kashmir-fund-website
   echo "whsec_YOUR_SECRET" | vercel env add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET production
   vercel --prod
   ```
